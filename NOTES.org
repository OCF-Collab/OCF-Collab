* Status
** Infrastructure
*** 1 - 2 days needed to setup Cloud66 environment
** Indexing worker
*** 2 - 3 days needed to implement S3 notifications and ES sync
** Search API
*** Attach plan ready. Needs 3-4 days to implement.
** Single freamwork fetch API
*** Suggestion #2: Instead of using multipart/mixed for returning the actual asset expose assetUrl in the response envelope.
**** The asset endpoint can be authenticated in the same way as main request endpoint or simply public URL if it's already exposed.
*** MI looks good for what we need it to do
**** Open item: Will it be authenticated in final version?
*** PNA verifying received access token as described in specification makes sense. We don't need another authentication method.
** Policies/Licenses
*** Still a black box. Would be nice to have a chat with anyone who provided the specification.
** Transaction/Logging
*** Looks good.
** We look great for end of November
